# GraphDbETL

An ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) toolkit for graph databases.

Specifically, GraphDbETL is designed to make it easier to integrate data from
public third-party databases (especially relational and flat databases) into
a single graph database.

This project is motivated by [ComptoxAI](https://comptox.ai/), and the 
challenges associated with building its central graph database.
